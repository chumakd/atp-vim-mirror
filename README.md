Mirror of AutomaticLaTeXPlugin Vim plugin, which is hosted on sourceforge.net in svn.

Official project site: http://atp-vim.sourceforge.net/

This is intended for my private use and is not an "official" git mirror. I'm not
going to synchronize it frequently with original svn repo, maybe once in one or
two months.
