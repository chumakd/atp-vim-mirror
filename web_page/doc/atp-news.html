<h2>Changes in version 9.6</h2>

<p>Some functions where rewritten in python making ATP much faster.</p>

  <p>ATP loads 1/3 faster (after first run when you save project file, which is
  done when you save your file!).</p>

  <p>Use g:atp_no_local_abbreviations if you don't want to have abbreviations to
  locally defined environments (this takes time if your vim was compiled
  without |+python| feature, as it runs <a href="atp-completion.html#atp-:LocalCommands">atp-:LocalCommands</a> command - which
  is slow in this case). </p>

  <p>Note: the python version of LocalCommands will save the current buffer,
  without saving project script and with 'nowritebackup' and 'nobackup' set. </p>

  <p>I added <a href="#b:atp_LocalEnvironments">b:atp_LocalEnvironments</a>, <a
      href="#b:atp_LocalCommands">b:atp_LocalCommands</a> and <a
      href="#b:atp_LocalColors">b:atp_LocalColors</a> to <a
      href="atp-ProjectFiles.html#g:atp_ProjectLocalVariables">g:atp_ProjectLocalVariables</a> if
  vim doesn't have +python feature otherwise <a
      href="#g:atp_local_completion">g:atp_local_completion</a> is set to 2,
  hence <a href="atp-completion.html#atp-:LocalCommands">atp-:LocalCommands</a> is run with
  BufEnter. It is so because the function LocalCommands was written also in
  python which is more than 10 times faster than the old vim
  implementation.</p>

  <p><a href="#atp-:ViewOutput">atp-:ViewOutput</a> -- removed the [sync] argument.</p>

  <p><a href="#atp-:BibSearch">atp-:BibSearch</a> is written in python. It is much faster. Thus the argument
  should be a python regular expression. If you want to use vim script (and
  vim regular expression) set <a href="#g:atp_bibsearch">g:atp_bibsearch</a>="vim". Then both Tab
  Completion and <a href="#atp-:BibSearch">atp-:BibSearch</a> will use vim code.</p>

  <p>Tab completion for labels (\ref and \eqref commands) gives more information
  inside the popup menu.</p>
 
  <p>The F2 map is back -- it turns on/off <space> cmap to \_s\+. But this time
  this map by default is turned on. It is made to it doesn't interact with
  other command modes than / and ?. If you want to turn in off/on use F2. If
  you want to turn it off in your vimrc or <a href="atp-configure.html#atprc">atprc</a> files
  use: <div class=variable>let g:atp_cmap_space = 0</div> Pressing F2 will
  define this map.</p>


  <p>Some other small fixes.</p>

<h2>Changes in version 9.5</h2>

    <p>The keys j, k, gj and gk are no longer mapped by ATP. There is a better
    solution for updating the Table of Contents highlighted line. It is done
    using autocommand CursorHold.</p>

    <p>See the new command <a href="#atp-:Tags">atp-:Tags</a>.</p>

<a href="#atp-:Dsearc">atp-:Dsearch</a>
<div class=command>:Dsearch</div>
    <p>This used to be :DefiSearch. This I found more in vim style.
    Also <a href="#g:atp_DsearchMaxWindowHeight">g:atp_DsearchMaxWindowHeight</a> is used instead of
    g:atp_DefiSearchMaxWindowHeight.</p>

<p><a href="#g:atp_statusOutDir">g:atp_statusOutDir</a> fixed.</p>
<p><a href="#g:atp_IMapCC">g:atp_IMapCC</a> instead of g:atp_MapCC.</p>

<p>And bunch of other fixes :).</p>

<h3>TIP</h3>
<p>Checkout cmdalias plugin (vimscript#745). It lets define lower case
aliases to commands. You can put in your <a href="atp-configure.html#atprc">atprc</a> file:
<div class=indented>Alias tex TEX</div>
<div class=indented>Alias toc TOC</div></p>

<h2>Changes in version 9.4</h2>

<h3>ATP and Gentoo Linux</h3>
<p>Thanks to Tim Harder there is a gentoo ebuild, if you use gentoo check for
automatictexplugin in the portage tree.</p>

<h3>Completion</h3>
<p>Small but nice change in closing environments: If you type
\begin{envname}<Tab> the cursor position will not change. You can use
i_CTRL-M (i_CTRL-J is used by <a href="#atp-j_motion">atp-j_motion</a>) after <Tab> to open new
line inside {envname}.  Otherwise the cursor position will be right after
the closing \end{envname}.</p>

<h3>Local Commands</h3>
<p><a href="atp-completion.html#atp-:LocalCommands">atp-:LocalCommands</a><br>
<div class=double_indent>-- do not search in comments, </div>
<div class=double_indent>-- add single { if command has defined arguments.</div></p>

<p>Note: the format of viewer options has changed from a string to a vim
list.  Every option and its value should be placed as a separate element
of vim list.  See <a href="atp-configure.html#atp-Viewers_Options">atp-Viewers_Options</a> for examples.</p>

<h3>New Imaps</h3>
<p>New imaps for some commonly used math commands: see <a href="#atp-imap-math">atp-imap-math</a>.</p> 

<p>All mathematical imaps: for symbols, greek letters, are defined only when
inside LaTeX (or TeX) mathematical environment.</p> 

<p>There is new predefined layout for environment imaps available, but
disabled by default. If you like longer and more intuitive environment
insert mode maps set <a
    href="#g:atp_ShortEnvIMaps">g:atp_ShortEnvIMaps</a>=0 in your vimrc or
<a href="atp-configure.html#atpr">atprc</a>c files. Use <a
    href="#atp-:HelpEnvIMaps">atp-:HelpEnvIMaps</a> to see them. There is
also one new environment ]let in this new layout which inputs a letter
environment. If you want a short imap for it you can set
g:atp_imap_letter="w" and ATP will make a map ]w for it.  Note that "l",
and "L" are already taken and using "le" will slow down "l", also "e" and
"r" are used, so there is no good choice for it. You can set <a
    href="#g:atp_letter_opening">g:atp_letter_opening</a> and <a
    href="#g:atp_letter_closing">g:atp_letter_closing</a> to customize
default opening and closing statements.</p>

<p>If you decide to use short imaps (the default) there is one change: ]i is
mapped to \item and ]I is mapped to itemize environment (this is the only
type of change in the short layout. In long layout ]I is mapped ot \item
and ]ite is mapped to itemize environment.</p>

<p>There is also a small change with <Tab> completion: after typing
\begin{envname}<Tab> the cursor will not move, so you can use |i_CTRL-M|
to open new line.</p>

<p>The abbreviations are customizable: g:atp_imap_{envname}, also the
leader is customizable with <a
    href="#g:atp_imap_third_leader">g:atp_imap_third_leader</a> and
environment names for example if you set <a
    href="#g:atp_EnvNameTheorem">g:atp_EnvNameTheorem</a>="thm" then ]the
imap will insert \begin{thm}:\end{thm} pair. You can list supported
environments with ':let g:atp_EnvName<C-d>'. If you set
g:atp_imap_{envname} to empty string "" the corresponding imap will not be
defined.</p>

<p>See also <a href="atp-mappings.html#atp-:ToggleMathIMaps">atp-:ToggleMathIMaps</a>.</p>

<h3>New Motions</h3>
<a name="atp-&gtE"></a> <a name="atp-&ltE"></a> <p>There are two more nice map
>E which is something like %>e, i.e. jump over the current environment and
go to next one. The reverse <E is also implemented, thought it is not
simply <e%. They do not support count (yet), and actually count breaks
them. If you want to add zz, (zt or zb) after >E you can put this in your
<a href="atp-configure.html#atprc">atprc</a> file:
<div class=indented>map &ltbuffer&gt &ltsilent&gt &gtE	&ltPlug&gtJumptoNextEnvironmentzz</div>
<div class=indented>map &ltbuffer&gt &ltsilent&gt &ltE	&ltPlug&gtJumptoPreviousEnvironmentzz</div></p>

<p><a href="atp-commands.html#atp--S">atp--S</a>, <a href="atp-commands.html#atp--s">atp--s</a>, <a
    href="atp-commands.html#atp--c">atp--c</a>, <a href="atp-commands.html#atp--p">atp--p</a> new maps for <a
    href="atp-commands.html#atp-:SSec">atp-:SSec</a>, <a href="atp-commands.html#atp-:Sec">atp-:Sec</a>, <a
    href="atp-commands.html#atp-:Chap">atp-:Chap</a> and <a href="atp-commands.html#atp-:Part">atp-:Part</a>.
They also works relatively to the current unit (section/chapter/part), i.e.
2]s will jump to second section of the current chapter.</p>


<h3>Updatetime</h3>
<p><a href="#g:atp_updatetime_insert">g:atp_updatetime_insert</a> can be
changed on the fly to 0 (previously it requires to quitting vim and making
changes in vimrc/<a href="atp-configure.html#atprc">atprc</a> files.</p> 

<h3>Make LaTeX</h3>
<p><a href="atp-commands.html#atp-:MakeLatex">atp-:MakeLatex</a> is rewritten in python. The
"!" is not yet implemented.</p>

<h3>Python 3 Compatibility</h3>
<p>All python scripts are compatible with Python 3. Traceback info is
forwarded to vim (and log files) in case exceptions are handled.</p>

<h3>Dictionaries</h3>
<p>I added extended versions of dictionaries of latex-suite to ATP (the files
dictionaries/dictionary and dictionary/SIunits). They are added to
'complete' vim option, so you can use them through ins-completion.
I made one more dictionary (dictionaries/ams_dictionary) with ams commands
and environment names. It will be added to the vim 'complete' option if
you use amsmath package or if the document class is one of the standard
ams classes or of <a href="#g:atp_amsmath">g:atp_amsmath</a> is set to 1.</p>

<h3>Status Line</h3>
<p>Status notifications has the ability to show if <a
    href="#b:atp_BibCompiler">b:atp_BibCompiler</a>, or "makeindex" are
running. Unless |g:atp_statusNotif|=0 or <a
    href="#g:atp_callback">g:atp_callback</a>=0 <a
    href="atp-commands.html#atp-:MakeLatex">atp-:MakeLatex</a> will echo a single message
when it returns.</p>

<p>There is also new status line for QuickFix window with number of errors
and warnings printed (this depends on <a href="atp-commands.html#b:atp_ErrorFormat">b:atp_ErrorFormat</a>).</p>

<h3>Biber and Biblatex Support</h3>
<p>Support for biber and biblatex is added (in <a href="atp-commands.html#atp-:MakeLatex">atp-:MakeLatex</a>,
<a href="atp-commands.html#atp-:Bibtex">atp-:Bibtex</a>, <a
    href="atp-commands.html#atp-:Delete">atp-:Delete</a>, <a
    href="atp-commands.html#atp-:InputFiles">atp-:InputFiles</a> commands), <a
    href="atp-configure#g:atp_keep">g:atp_keep</a>
variable will adjust on the fly (add run.xml and bcf extensions).
<a href="#b:atp_BibCommand">b:atp_BibCommand</a> will be set to biber if the preamble contains
\usepackage[backend=biber]{biblatex}</p>

<p>If you use biblatex, it allows for putting \bibliography{} type commands
only in the preamble. Thus ATP will search for them only there. The <a
    href="atp-commands.html#g:atp_inputfile_pattern">g:atp_inputfile_pattern</a> might not
contain any pattern for bibliographies (\addbibresource, \bibliography,
etc.). The <a href="atp-commands.html#atp-:InputFiles">atp-:InputFiles</a> command will
search for them in a special subroutine which only searches in the
preamble.  This makes it work slightly faster.</p>

<h3>TeX Options Variable (new format)</h3>
<p><a href="#b:atp_TexOptions">b:atp_TexOptions</a> is a comma separated list of TeX compiler options.
If you use <a href="#g:atp_Compiler">g:atp_Compiler</a>="bash" this might be just a white space
separated list.</p>
<a href="#atp-space">atp-space</a>
<h3>Space Cmap</h3>
<div class=map>cmap <buffer> <C-Space> 	\_s\+</div>
<div class=map>cmap <buffer> <C-_> 	\_s\+</div>
<p>The C-Space Vim, instead C-@ is used which works as C-Space. In Vim, and
gVim as well, you can also use <a href="#atp-Q/">atp-Q/</a>, <a
    href="#atp-Q?">atp-Q?</a> where <Space> is mapped to \_s\+.</p>

<p>Note: from version 9.6 Space is mapped to \_s\+ in cmdline modes / and
?.  F2 turns it on/off. The above maps are always on.</p>

<h3>Errors</h3><br>
<div class=map>nmap &ltLocalLeader&gte</div>
<p>To get list of errors with current <a href="atp-commands.html#b:atp_ErrorFormat">b:atp_ErrorFormat</a>.</p>
<a href="atp-commands.html#atp-:ErrorFormat">atp-:ErrorFormat</a>
<div class=command>:ErrorFormat {efm}</div>
<p>This is new interface to :SetErrorFormat. If {efm} is not given it will
show the current value <a href="atp-commands.html#b:atp_ErrorFormat">b:atp_ErrorFormat</a>. It sets the variable
<a href="atp-commands.html#b:atp_ErrorFormat">b:atp_ErrorFormat</a> and rereads the log file with |cgetfile|. The variable
<a href="atp-commands.html#b:atp_ErrorFormat">b:atp_ErrorFormat</a> is also set when you use the command
<a href="atp-commands.html#atp-:ShowErrors">atp-:ShowErrors</a>. In addition you can use +{flag} and -{flag} as an
argument, then {flag} will be added/removed from <a href="atp-commands.html#b:atp_ErrorFormat">b:atp_ErrorFormat</a>.</p>

<h3>EasyMotion and ATP</h3>
<p>If you want to use <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3526">EaseMotion</a> vim plugin (which is quite handy).</p>
	
<p>You can set <a href="#g:atp_Compare">g:atp_Compare</a>="". Alternatively, if
you want to use the fastest comparing method of ATP, you can add to last line
of s:EasyMotion() function in plugin/EasyMotion.vim add <dev class=intended>let
g:atp_changedtick = b:changedtick</div> You might want to change
g:EasyMotion_leader_key (see |easymotion-leader-key| if you have EasyMotion),
because some maps of ATP are interfering with EasyMotion. For example "-" might
be a good choice.  You can also try to change |maplocalleader| which is heavily
used by ATP.</p>

<p>Select Comments nmap and vmap is now |_c| (previously \sc was
interfering with an ATP font map).</p>

<p>(Almost all) maps became :map-silent.</p> 

<h3>ATPRC</h3>
<p>The <a href="atp-configure.html#atprc">atprc</a> file is now sourced twice at startup: at the
beginning to set the variables, and once again at the end to set the maps
defined in it.</p>

<h3>Quickfix Window</h3>
<p>Despite the status line for quick fix window, :cgetfile will be run when you
open new files, this nicely works with :edit command but not :split if you want
to keep the old log file in QuickFix window. If this is the case set 
<div class=variable>let g:atp_cgetfile = 0</div>
You can also put this in your <a href="#atprc">atprc</a> or |vimrc| file.</p>

<h3>Debug ATP</h3>
<div class=command>:DebugPrint</div>
<p>if you want to develop/debug ATP set g:atp_atpdev to 1 run <a
    href="atp-commands.html#atp-:ReloadATP">atp-:ReloadATP</a> and this command will allow to
print (cat) debug files under <a href="#g:atp_TempDir">g:atp_TempDir</a>.</p>


<p>I hope I didn't missed anything important. If you want to see detailed changes
you can always read the svn logs at <a href="#atp-sourceforge">atp-sourceforge</a>.<p><br>
