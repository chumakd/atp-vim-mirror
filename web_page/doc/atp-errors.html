<h2>DEBUGGING ATP</h2>

    <p>This section describes some limitation of ATP (as you see, this section is
    not written, but the aim is to make it disappear anyway ;).</p>

    <p>There are many debug variables with names g:atp_debug{fname} where {fname} is
    a shortname of the function for which it will turn on the debug info. These
    variables are documented in ftplugin/ATP_files/options.vim file.</p>

    <a name="atp-errors-bibsearch"></a>
    <p>A possible error which may occur using the :BibSearch commands has a simple
    cause: we count number of brackets '()', '{}' and '"' (but nor '\"') to see
    where the bib entry ends and where to join lines. The message error is echoed
    when more than 30 lines where processed and the matching bracket was not found
    (or the number of '"' is odd). Look at your bib file at the specified
    position.  Syntax highlighting for bib files can help you finding where such
    an error is located. (After reading the bib file comment lines and lines which
    begin with @string are removed, so that the brackets in comment lines do not
    count.)</p>
