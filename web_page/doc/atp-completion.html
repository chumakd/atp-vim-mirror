<h2>COMPLETION</h2>
<div>
    <p class="alignleft"><a href="atp-bibsearch.html">Previous:</a> BibSearch</p>
    <p class="aligncenter"><a href="index.html">Table of Contents</a></p>
    <p class="alignright"><a href="atp-omnicompletion.html">Next:</a> Omni Completion</p>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<p>The completion is by default mapped to <Tab>. For example if you type
\math<Tab> you will get a list of choices which completes this command. (See
':h popupmenu-completion' and ':h completion' for more).</p>

<a name="atp-completion-expert-mode"></a> <a name="atp-completion-non-expert-mode"></a>
<p>There are two completion algorithm: expert mode  and non expert mode: the
keyword for completion in expert mode must match at the beginning, in non
expert mode any where. Also in expert mode the list of possible completions is
smaller (for example there is no '\lneqq', there is only '\lneq').</p>

<p>Note: Non expert mode doesn't check if you are editing math (see
<a href="#g:atp_MathOpened">g:atp_MathOpened</a>), and is useful when you want to complete a non-math
command inside mathematics.</p>

<a name="atp-Tab-note"></a>
<p>If you prefer to not map &ltTab&gt key then you can define
g:atp_no_tab_map=1 in your vimrc file or <a href="atp-configure.html#atprc">atprc</a> file. Note that Vim can
add/remove tabshift width from the beginning of line in other ways: in normal
mode with |&gt&gt| and |&lt&lt|, in insert mode: |i_CTRL-T|, |i_CTRL-D| and in
visual mode with |&gt| and |&lt|. Also you can use <a
    href="#atp-g>">atp-g&gt</a> and <a href="#atp-g<">atp-g&lt</a>. The
alignment of tabular and other environments can be done with <a
    href="#atp-:TexAlign">atp-:TexAlign</a> command.</p> 

<p>You can switch off/on completion modes adjusting the variable
'g:atp_completion_active_modes', all names of completion modes are stored in
the variable 'g:atp_tab_completion_modes'.</p>

<a name="g:atp_local_completion"></a>
<p>If <a href="#g:atp_local_completion">g:atp_local_completion</a> is set to
non zero value, then input files will be scanned for \def, \newcommand,
\newnevironment and \newtheorem commands and they will be used for completion
(with <a href="atp-completion.html#atp-:LocalCommands">atp-:LocalCommands</a>). If its value is
1 then this will be done during first completion, if it is set to 2 then this
will be done at start up. The default value is 2 when vim has |+python| feature
otherwise it is 1. With |+python| this is done at every time you use the Tab
completion.</p>

<p>NOTE: if you press &ltTab&gt but then you changed your mind, the completion pop-up
menu allows to cancel completion: press ctrl+p (i.e.  go up - some times more
than once) and then press &ltspace&gt.</p>

<p>Note: Completion checks the preamble for definitions of LaTeX packages. If
a supported package is present (for example: tikz) then the completion will
contain additional commands. If you add a package or a class you should unlet
corresponding variable: <a href="atp-completion.html#g:atp_LatexPackages">g:atp_LatexPackages</a>
and <a href="atp-completion.html#g:atp_LatexClasses">g:atp_LatexClasses</a>.</p>

<a name="atp-:ToggleTab"></a>
<div class=command>:ToggleTab</div>
<div class=map>nmap, imap `&ltTab&gt</div>
    <p>It is a command to toggle the tab map off/on: :ToggleTab, it is also mapped
    to `&ltTab&gt.</p> 

    <p>Note: see <a href="#atp-Tab-note">atp-Tab-note</a>.</p>

<h3>Completion Modes</h3>
<h4>commands</h4>
		<div class=indented><p>if g:atp_check_if_math_mode = 1 then the pull of commands
		contains math commands only if there you are inside a math
		environment. This works perfectly if you switch from $:$ and
		$$:$$ to their equivalent (and more up-to-date) \(:\) and \[:\].
		The list of math environment in which ATP will think you are
		editing a math mode is stored in the variable:
		'g:atp_math_modes'. Its entries are two element list of
		patterns which matches the beginning and end of a math mode.
		The '0' entry have to provide the beginning and end pattern of
		in line math '\(:\)', the second for displayed math '\[:\]'.
		Its default value is given below.</p>
	
		<p>If you add a package (like tikz or amsmath, or amssymb) then
		the set of completions will contain extra commands/environment
		names defined in these packages  Because some classes calls
		amsmath package silently setting the variable
		'g:atp_amsmath=1' will ensure that you will get completions
		for these commands. The algorithm checks if you have this
		package declared or if you use some of the standard ams
		class (actually checks if the document class name matches
		'^ams').</p> 

		<p>If you do not want math commands completions at all define
		':let g:atp_no_math_command_completion=1' (you can put it in
		your |vimrc| or <a href="atp-configure.html#atprc">atprc </a>file, or define while writing,
		both will work, so you can switch off the math completions
		temporarily).</p>

		<p>The label command completes in a special way: for example in
		a line like:
			<div class=example>\begin{theorem}\lab&ltTab&gt</div>
		will complete to 
			<div class=example>\begin{theorem}\label{thm:</div>
		The dictionary of short names is 'g:atp_shortname_dict'. If
		you do not likes this idea (however it can help you to
		correctly write \ref{ - to avoid referring to lemmas as
		propositions, and also it makes completion for \ref{ nicer
		- you can list only labels for theorems), so if you do not
		want it anyway: 'let g:atp_no_short_names=1' will make the
		work.</p> 
		<a name="g:atp_amsmath"></a>
		<p>If <a href="#g:atp_amsmath">g:atp_amsmath=</a>1 or you use one of ams classes, or the
		package amsmath is found by ATP ams math commands and
		environment names will be added to the list of completions.</p>

		<a name="atp-variables-local_completion"></a> <a name="b:atp_LocalColors"></a> <a name="b:atp_LocalCommands"></a> <a name="b:atp_LocalEnvironments"></a>
		<p>By default the first time you are completing an environment
		name or a command a list of locally defined environments and
		commands is made (it takes a few seconds). If you do not want
		to completions for them define "let <a href="#g:atp_local_completion">g:atp_local_completion=</a>0",
		if <a href="#g:atp_local_completion">g:atp_local_completion=</a>2" then the search for local
		definitions and commands will be done on startup (after
		version 8.4 for this you have to switch off abbreviations by
		setting g:atp_noabbreviations to 1 - but anyway it is not time
		consuming because these variables are loaded from
		<a href="atp-ProjectFiles.html#atp-ProjectScript">atp-ProjectScript)</a>.</p>

		<a name="atp-:LocalCommands"></a>	
<div class=command>:LocalCommands[!]</div>
		<p>If you added a command or an environment the command
		:LocalCommands! will update the list of local definitions.
		With bang "!" it update the list of input files
		<a href="#b:ListOfFiles">b:ListOfFiles </a>in which the search is done. The output is
		stored in three variables:
				<div class=variable>b:atp_LocalColors</div>
				<div class=variable>b:atp_LocalCommands</div>
				<div class=variable>b:atp_LocalEnvironments</div>
		If a command was declared with a arguments (i.e. using #1, or
		#1#2, etc.) a single '{' is attached. It doesn't match for
		definitions inside comments.</p>

		<p>Note: the python version searches for commands, environments,
		...  defined in the begining of line (with possible white
		spaces).</p>

		<p>Note: the python version of LocalCommands will save the
		current buffer, without saving project script and with
		'nowritebackup' and 'nobackup' set.</p></div>

	    <a name="atp-tikzpicture"></a>
	    <h4>tikzpicture</h4><div class=indented>
		<p>There is an extended support for tikz picture environment both
		inline \tikz{:} and displayed: \begin{tikzpicture}
		\end{tikzpicture}. The completion works for both commands and
		keywords. The pull of them is enlarged if you add tikz
		libraries. Normal commands are added if you are inside {:}.</p></div>

	    <a name="atp-completion-ref"></a> <a name="atp-completion-label"></a> <a name="atp-completion-cite"></a>
	    <h4>ref/label/cite</h4><div class=indented>
		<p>For label completion puts short names, for ref and eqref
		commands the completions are the labels found in all files
		associated to the main file (the plugin searches the input
		and include files for them). The same for cite: which searches
		also in bib files defined in the main file.</p>

		<p>In the popup menu the first column show the label name, second
		column contains the first letter of the counter name used:
		e for equation, t for theorem, s for section, c for chapter,
		I for Item, etc. - these are the most common things you will
		see. The third column contains the value of the counter. It is
		put in brackets () if it comes from equation counter.</p>

		<p>There is also omnicompletion (CTRL-X CTRL-O, see
		|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|) for \cite command. Check it out, as it is
		very nice (especially in gvim!) and very fast.</p> 

		<p>For both completion and omnicompletion for the cite command,
		the text after \cite{  [ or after a comma after \cite{ ] is
		treated as a regular expression. Thus you can write:
		<div class=example>\cite{.*author1\&.*author2&ltTab&gt</div>
		to get the completions for things written by both author 1 and
		2 (regardless of the order they appear in bib files).</p>

		<p>BibTeX omni completion is triggered by '\cite{', '\citep{' or
		'\citet{'.  For example, assume you have in your .bib files an
		entry looking like:</p>
<pre>
		@book {	knuth1981,
				author = "Donald E. Knuth",
				title = "Seminumerical Algorithms",
				publisher = "Addison-Wesley",
				year = "1981" }
</pre>
		<p>Then, try:
			<div class=example>\cite{Knuth 1981&ltCTRL-X&gt&ltCTRL-O&gt</div>
			<div class=example>\cite{algo&ltCTRL-X&gt&ltCTRL-O&gt</div>
		\ref{{pattern}<Tab> matches the label name for the {pattern}.
		When pattern is matched for a number of a label '^' is added in
		front of the pattern (see below). In this case both completion modes:
		expert and non-expert works in the same way.</p>

		<p>You can also use Vim patterns after '\cite{'.</p>

		<p>Tab Completion for labels (|atp-completion|) allows to specify
		the number of the counter, e.g.
			<div class=example>\ref{3.1&ltTab&gt</div>
		will complete into the label of the counter with value '3.1'.
		As for now you can not specify which counter to complete. You
		can also write '\ref{3.1$' then '^3.1$' is used as a pattern!</p>

		<p>For this two work the aux file must be present.  As for now
		the aux file, if it is not present, is not made.</p>

		<p>This is working with the main document classes: article, book,
		review, amsart, amsbook, memoir. If for some class it is not
		working thanks for reporting me (it's enough to email me just
		the document class).</p></div>

	    <a name="atp-completion-brackets"></a>
	    <h4>brackets</h4><div class=indented>
		<p>Closing of brackets {:},{:},[:],(:) (also closes math modes \(:\) and
		\[:\]). 
		Relevant variables are: g:atp_bracket_dict a dictionary of
		brackets by default it consists of pairs '(' : ')', '{' : '}',
		'[' : ']'. There is a second dictionary g:atp_sizes_of_brackets
		which contains all the sizes of brackets in latex plus a pair
		'\' : '\', for closing the math modes: \(:\), \[:\] and the
		brackets \{:\}.</p></div>
		<a name="atp-closing-environments"></a> <a name="atp-completion-env"></a>
	    <h4>environments</h4><div class=indented>
		<p>Completes after '\begin{' and '\end{'. For example
		'\begin{cen<Tab>' will give '\begin{center}' 
		But '\begin{theorem}<Tab>' or
		'\begin{theorem}\label{thm:1}<Tab> will close the environment.
		The algorithm tries to close environment in many natural
		situations: for example when it did found less than one command
		completion. It closes the right environment when they are
		nested (however not in right place!) and it preserves the
		indention. When after \begin{center}\label{...} XXX there is
		something (in place of XXX) it will close the environment
		after the cursor position otherwise in next line
		(\hypertarget{...}{...} command is treated like \lebl{...}).</p>

		<p>The environments opened in tex definitions ('\def',
		'\newcommand', '\renewcommand') will not be closed unless the
		current cursor position is in that line (sometimes one might
		want to have a definition which only opens an environment).</p>

		<p>If you type \begin{envname}<Tab> the cursor position will not
		change. You can use |i_CTRL-M| (|i_CTRL-J| is used by
		|atp-j_motion|) after <Tab> to open new line inside {envname}.
		Otherwise the cursor position will be right after the closing
		\end{envname}.</p>

		<p>See <a href="#g:atp_amsmath">g:atp_amsmath.</a></p></div>

	    <h5>Examples:</h5><div class=indented>

	    <a name="atp-completion-abbreviations"></a>
	    <h4>abbreviations</h4><div class=indented>
		<p>There is tab completion for insert mode abbreviation names

<h3>ATP Completion Variables</h3>

<p>These are all variables which can help to customise the completion:
(if the value is given it is the default, if it is not means it is too long to
put it here).</p>
<a name="g:atp_completion_limits"></a>
<div class=variable>g:atp_completion_limits		= [ '40', '60', '80',
    '100' ]</div>
<p>The above variable specifies how long should atp plugin search for
closed/unclosed environments:
<pre>
	    the first value 	- search for \(:\)  [ in line math ]
	    the second	 	- search for \[:\]  [ displayed math ]
	    the third	 	- search for \begin{<env>:\end{<env>	
	    the fourth	 	- for environments defined in the variable
</pre></p>
<div class=variable>g:atp_long_environments</div>
<p>You can also put "-1" as the values of g:atp_completion_limits, then the
search forward/backward will last till first/last line. However, this makes it
run slower.</p>
<a name="g:atp_long_environments"></a>
    <div class=variable>g:atp_long_environments 	= []</div>
<p>If some of your environments are very long put their names in this list. Do
not forget that is environment &ltenv&gt is long and is put inside environment
&ltcenter&gt then &ltcenter&gt is also long!</p>
				 
<p>However, this will not close long environments (for that you have to change
the third argument of g:atp_completion_limits !). This just prevents closing
environments which are closed and to long to see that.</p>
<pre><div class=variable>g:atp_completion_modes = [

<div class=variable>g:atp_sort_completion_list	= 12</div>
<p>If the length of completion list for Tab Completion is longer than this

<a name="g:atp_MathOpened"></a>
<div class=variable>g:atp_MathOpened		= 1</div>
the default value is 1. With the default value expert mode completion will
check if you are completing inside mathematical environment or not. Inside
math environment only math commands are completed and outside math commands
are disabled. This makes the set of completions more accurate. If you need non
math command (like \textrm{}) inside math use non expert mode (see <a

<p>List of environments which is not closed by &lttab&gt completion. (The
document environment in longer documents can be not seen by the algorithm as
closed, because it searches only in a part of the text, see <a

above).</p>

<p>The variables: </p>
<div class=variable>g:atp_LatexPackages</div>
<div class=variable>g:atp_LatexClasses</div>
<p>stores list of packages and classes in your tex distribution. They are
restored when you exit Vim from the global project script (see <a
    href="atp-ProjectFiles.html#atp-ProjectScript_global">atp-ProjectScript_global</a>).  They are
used for completion of the LaTeX commands \usepackage and \documentclass.</p>

<p>If you reinstall, add or remove tex classes/packages from your tex
distribution it is enough to unlet these variables. ATP will find new values
when it will need them for the first time.</p>
