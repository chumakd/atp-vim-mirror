<p>This plugin requires Vim version 7.3.  Several tools uses syntax, so even if
you do not like colours on the screen you should set "syntax on". For example,
the recognition of math mode used by |atp-completion|, and |atp-:TexAlign|
command (but also some other things, and some maps!).</p>

<a name="atp-requirements-python"></a>
<p>ATP uses python 2.7 (also works with python 3). You need psutil library which
you can get from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/psutil/">here</a>.
    
<p>Other libraries are standard ones so they should be available. If you have
a problem you can try to set g:atp_debugPythonCompiler=1 and then look at the
file PythonCompiler.log under <a href="#g:atp_TempDir">g:atp_TempDir</a> it
will contain python errors.</p>

<p>It is nice to have 'texdoc' program. This plugin maps <F1> to a function which
calls it. This allows to speed up searches for documentation. Also the option
'keywordprg' has the value "texdoc -m", thus pressing 'K' (see |K|) over a tex
package should open you the package documentation. The same applies to this
help file.</p>

<p>Another good programs are: texloganalyzer (which is now not used by ATP) and pdffonts
There is a map to use pdffonts, see: <a href="#pdffonts">pdffonts</a>.</p>

<p>The command <a href="#atp-:WordCount">atp-:WordCount</a> is using detex program. It is included in TexLive
tex distrubution.</p>
